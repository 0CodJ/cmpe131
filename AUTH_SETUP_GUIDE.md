# 🚀 Historical Events App - Authentication & Suggestion System Setup Guide

## 📋 What We've Built

Your Historical Events app now includes:

✅ **User Authentication** (Login/Register)  
✅ **Role-based Access Control** (User/Admin roles)  
✅ **Suggestion System** (Users can suggest changes to events)  
✅ **Admin Panel** (Admins can review and approve/reject suggestions)  
✅ **Enhanced Security** (Row Level Security policies)  

## 🗄️ Step 1: Database Setup

### Run the SQL Script

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste** the entire contents of `database-setup.sql`
3. **Click "Run"** to execute all the queries
4. **Verify tables were created**:
   - `profiles` (user information)
   - `suggestions` (user suggestions for changes)
   - `historical_events` (existing, now with `created_by` column)

### Make Yourself an Admin

After creating your first user account:

1. **Go to SQL Editor** in Supabase
2. **Run this command** (replace with your email):
   ```sql
   SELECT make_user_admin('your-email@example.com');
   ```
3. **You're now an admin!** 👑

## 🎯 Step 2: Test the Features

### Authentication Flow

1. **Open your app**: `http://localhost:5173/`
2. **Click "Sign Up"** in the top-right corner
3. **Create an account** with username, email, password
4. **Check your email** for verification (optional)
5. **Sign in** with your credentials

### User Features

**When logged in as a regular user:**
- ✅ Add custom historical events
- ✅ Suggest changes to existing events
- ✅ View all events (API + custom)

### Admin Features

**When logged in as an admin:**
- 👑 **Crown icon** appears next to username
- 🛡️ **Admin Panel** option in profile dropdown
- ✅ **Review suggestions** (approve/reject)
- ✅ **Manage all user content**

### Suggestion Workflow

1. **Find any historical event** on the main page
2. **Click "Suggest Edit"** button (yellow button on each event)
3. **If not logged in**: prompted to sign in first
4. **If logged in**: Suggestion modal opens
5. **Make your changes** and provide a reason
6. **Submit suggestion**
7. **Admin reviews** in Admin Panel
8. **If approved**: Event is updated with your changes! 🎉

## 🔐 Security Features

### Database Security

- **No direct password storage** (Supabase handles auth)

### Access Control
```typescript
// Users can suggest changes
user.canSuggestChanges = user.isAuthenticated

// Admins can approve suggestions
admin.canApproveChanges = user.role === 'admin'

user.canEditEvent = event.created_by === user.id || user.isAdmin
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Must be logged in" errors:**
- Check that user is authenticated: `console.log(user)`
- Verify Supabase connection working
- Check browser network tab for 401 errors

**Suggestions not appearing:**
- Verify `suggestions` table exists
- Check RLS policies are set up
- Ensure admin user has correct role

**Admin panel not accessible:**
- Run the `make_user_admin()` SQL function
- Check user role in `profiles` table
- Refresh the page after role change

### Database Verification

Check your tables exist:
```sql
-- Verify tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check your user role
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- View all suggestions
SELECT * FROM suggestions ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
